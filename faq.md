# Frequently Asked Questions

* **What file contains *X* data in a FACETS run?**

  Data for a FACETS run consists of a set of several files.  A facets run consists of a top level directory, containing fit directories for each FACETS fit for the sample.  Below are some details on specific files and their contents:
  * /facets_qc.txt - Contains a summary of data for the sample overall, and information about each existing fit for the sample.  Includes information about review status, quality check flags, and run parameters for each fit.
  * /fit_dir/*.arm_level.txt - Arm level data for the fit.  Gives an overall copy number state for each chromosome arm.
  * /fit_dir/*.gene_level.txt - Gene level information for the fit.  Segment data for regions overlapping genes are listed, along with the copy number calls and SNP data summary for the segments.
  * /fit_dir/*.cncf.txt - Contains data for integer copy number calls (TCN/LCN) and clonal fraction data for all segments. Generally the file of interest when looking for copy number calls for a fit.
  * /fit_dir/*.seg - General information about each segments position.
  * /fit_dir/*.png - Images generated by Facets-Suite that are used in Facets Preview.
  * /fit_dir/*.Rdata - The Rdata file stores specific information about the SNPs used to create the figures for this facets run. Can be inspected by loading into R.

* **How is FACETS data generated?**

  BAM files are initially compiled into SNP pileup files that can be used for FACETS processing.  FACETS data is generated by running [this script](https://github.com/mskcc/facets-suite/blob/7d54d0f67e3136bd60d94ad810a9c855df113096/run-facets-wrapper.R) from Facets-Suite, providing the SNP-pileup data as input.  This code is responsible for calling the FACETS algorithm, and generating output files and figures.  Note that if you want to load samples in Facets Preview, that the --legacy-output flag should be set to TRUE.  

* **What is the difference between hisens and purity runs?**

  Facets-Suite produces two versions for each FACETS run, suffixed in fit data by "_purity" or "_hisens".  The primary difference between these runs is the cValue provided for the run.  cValue is a smoothing metric that lets FACETS determine when to make breaks between segments.  A lower value will result in fewer segment breaks, whereas a higher value will result in a more strict interpretation of the data leading to more breaks.  Both runs are generated because depending on the intended analysis or the underlying data of the sample in question, different amounts of smoothing may be desired. IMPACT repositories by default use values of 100 and 500 respectively for purity and hisens. Using Facets Preview, it is also possible to submit fits with higher or lower cValues, to adjust smoothing as necessary for a given sample.

* **How do I identify IMPACT Facets Data for samples with *X* properties.**

  If you want to identify samples with specific properties, for example, samples of a specific cancer type or with whole genome duplication, contact [Adam Price](pricea2@mskcc.org) if you do not have access to the IMPACT repository on Terra/Juno/Iris.  If you do have access to the repository, the easiest way to interact and select samples is by using [FacetsAPI](http://github.com/mskcc/facetsAPI/).  FacetsAPI is a powerful toolkit for interacting with FACETS repositories with extensive documentation and easy to implement examples.  

* **What exactly are the CF and purity values generated by FACETS?**

  The CF value is the cellular fraction of non-diploid cells, which are assumed cancer cells. Purity is reported as the largest CF across the sample, with the assumption that the largest CF within the sample represents a clonal CNA. For any segment where CF = purity, the CNA on the segment is considered clonal.

* **Can I do refits on my FACETS data?**

  Facets Preview provides functionality for performing refits, however, results are stored in the active sample directory.  If you want to do refits on data, please first make a copy of the sample in question and load it into Facets Preview from a local location, rather than performing refits on mounted resources such as the IMPACT Facets Repository or the TEMPO WES Repository.  

* **How can I open FACETS data generated by the TEMPO pipeline?**
  
  TEMPO generates FACETS data with slightly different naming conventions than are currently compatable with Facets Preview.  To prepare your data to load with Facets Preview, it is necessary to change the *sample_id.facets_qc.txt* file in the top level facets directory to simply *facets_qc.txt*.  This will enable Facets Preview to properly read the data.  This issue will be resolved in future versions of Facets Preview.
