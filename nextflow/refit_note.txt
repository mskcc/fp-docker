This refit manager is intended to run as a service on a remote host, at the time of writing, Juno/Terra.

It requires a queue and a submitted directory, and will watch for new jobs and exectue them as they are submitted.

It is intended to run on the ipipe VM associated with Juno/Terra on a screen session at all times.


The required directory structure is:
.
├── lib
│   ├── facets
│   ├── facets-0.5.14
│   ├── facets-suite-2.0.8
│   └── pctGCdata-0.2.0
├── log
├── queue
├── refit_manager
│   └── work
└── submitted



with facets/ being an installed version of the facets library.

Users should mount this directory as the base for remote refits.
